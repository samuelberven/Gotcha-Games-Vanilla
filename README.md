Project Outline:

The publisher Gotcha Games earns $100 million in in-game microtransactions
annually, occurring in 8 games (developed by 4 developers). The price of their in-game
transactions range from $0.99 to $99.99.
Given its multiple partner developers (some of which develop multiple games), Gotcha
Games may find it difficult to accurately assess where it derives its greatest (as well as
most consistent) microtransaction-based profits. (This matter can refer to specific
microtransactions, specific regions, specific times, etc.).
However, this website will allow Gotcha Games to utilize its database to track its total
and partial sales figures, and keep track of its collaborating Developers, Games,
Customers, and Transactions. The resulting greater understanding of its performance
would in turn result in a greater ability for Gotcha Games to maximize its profits.
A customerâ€™s Google/Apple username is used for a transaction. The date for each
transaction is recorded to give Gotcha Games the ability to analyze the days and
months that sales are significantly stronger or weaker.
